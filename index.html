      <h2>CSS</h2>

      <ul>

        <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>

        <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside the element.</li>

        <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>

        <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet.</li>

        <li>When using an external style sheet, you link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head.</li>

        <li>Every HTML element is essentially a box. Each box consists of margins outside the element, and the element's borders, padding, and content.</li>

        <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written.</li>
