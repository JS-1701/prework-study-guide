# prework-study-guide

## Description
My motivation behind creating this website was to teach me the basic fundementals of HTML, CSS, GIT, and Javascript. Ill continue to use my website as a way to study and reflect on the early stages of learning. My goal going forward will be to learn as much as I can to better myself and my studies for a new carreer in the future! I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, GIT, and JavaScript and how to make them all work together.
